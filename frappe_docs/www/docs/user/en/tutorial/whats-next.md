# What's Next?

The goal of this tutorial was to give an introduction to the various parts of
the framework. We have only scratched the surface here. Frappe Framework has a
lot more features that have enabled us to build complex software such as
ERPNext.

You can deep dive into topics by going through the rest of the documentation.
Here are some topics to get you started:

1. [Architecture](/docs/user/en/basics/architecture)
2. [DocType](/docs/user/en/basics/doctypes)
3. [Document API](/docs/user/en/api/document)
4. [Form API](/docs/user/en/api/form)
5. [Bench CLI](/docs/user/en/bench)
